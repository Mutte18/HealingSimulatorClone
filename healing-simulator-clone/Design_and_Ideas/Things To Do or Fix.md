*Healing-simulator-Clone Ideas*

Raid members:
- There should be one or two tank raid members. These should have more health, but also take more damage. 
- There should be a few healer raid members. These will heal random players when alive
- The rest of the raid members should be normal damage dealers. Each one should deal X amount of damage per X time

Spell casting:
  Mana:
  - Potentionally mana orbs you can click as a distraction to gain mana
  - Add an error message when you dont have enough mana for casting a spell.
  
  Spells:
    Cooldown:
      Some spells should have a cooldown, limiting you how often you are able to cast it. Ideally it should show a
      rotating timer around the spell icon to show when it is ready again. Spells have a cooldown, but need a css
      animation on the icon. The cooldown is also not currently used.

  Castbar:
    Should show the time remaining on the cast as seconds.
    
Boss health:

Fun side-ideas:
  Healing meter:

Components:

  values send in)
  * Mana bar
  * Raid member
  * Raid boss
  * Spell bar
  * Spell icon
  * Raid frame
  * Logic (should this be a component?)
