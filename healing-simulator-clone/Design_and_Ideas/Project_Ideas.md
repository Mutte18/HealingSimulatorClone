*Healing-simulator-Clone Ideas*

Raid members:
- There should be one or two tank raid members. These should have more health, but also take more damage
- There should be a few healer raid members. These will heal random players when alive
- The rest of the raid members should be normal damage dealers. Each one should deal X amount of damage per X time

Spell casting:
  Mana:
  - Every spell should have a mana cost, usually the AoE healing spell costs a lot of mana since it heals alot of people.
    If you spam this spell you should go oom pretty fast
  - There should be slight mana regeneration, potentionally mana orbs you can click as a distraction to gain mana
  - The mana should be displayed as a blue mana bar so that you can easily keep track of it
  - If you don't have enough mana for a spell, it should show an error message on the screen, aswell as not allowing
    you to cast your spell.
  Cast bar:
  - There should be a cast bar for spells with a cast time. Once the cast bar is filled up the spell is cast.
  - There are spells with different lengths on the cast bar
  - The cast bar should not be shown when not casting.
  - The cast bar should take in cast time as argument to how fast it should fill
  Spells:
  - Quick heal:
      This heal should be fast to cast, but quite expensive. It should be used for sort of oh shit moments
  - AoE heal:
      This spell should heal X amount of raid members for a reasonable amount. It should be quite costly in mana
      so that you are not able to spam it.
    Cooldown:
      Some spells should have a cooldown, limiting you how often you are able to cast it. Ideally it should show a
      rotating timer around the spell icon to show when it is ready again.
  New spells:
    - Perhaps it would be cool if you unlock spells as you progress?
  Upgrading spells?:
    - You could also possibly upgrade existing spells

Objective of game:
  - You play as a raid group in combat with a boss monster. The boss monster has a great amount of hp, and you and your
  fellow raiders need to work together to take him down. The boss will deal great damage to your tanks, and continous
  AoE damage to the rest of the raid. With the use of your healing spells, and keeping track of your mana you need to
  keep your raid alive long enough so that they may kill the boss. The more players that are alive, the faster the boss
  will die. If a raider dies, he is dead and will hope that his carrying allies will do the job.

Targeting:
  MouseOverTargeting:
    - When casting a targeted spell, it will check if you are currently mousing over a raid member. If so it will be
      subject for the cast.
  ClickedTarget:
    - If there is no mouseOverTarget, then the spell will be cast on the target you have selected. The target you have
    selected is visisble with a red border around the raid frame.
Boss health:

Fun side-ideas:
  Healing meter:

Components:
  * Cast bar (Should accept a cast time, spell name)
  * Health bar (Could possibly be used for both boss and players, with different
  values send in)
  * Mana bar
  * Raid member
  * Raid boss
  * Spell bar
  * Spell icon
  * Raid frame
  * Logic (should this be a component?)
